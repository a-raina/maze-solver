# maze-solver
A small project that implements a backtracking algorithm and a A* algorithm to solve a maze.



To run the code you need to have python3 and the colorama module installed. You can install colorama 
via pip(pip install colorama).

maze.py is the main file where you can create mazes and run either the backtracking algorithm or the 
A * algorithm. To run the code, go to terminal/command prompt, navigate to the directory and run the 
command "python maze.py"
